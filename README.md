## 🛠️ How to Run

1. **Windows Only:** Required for `Beep()` and `system("CLS")` usage.
2. Compile using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ battleship.cpp -o battleship.exe
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./battleship.exe
   ```

## 📜 Game Rules (In-Game Menu Available)

- Each player has 3 ships of varying lengths.
- Place ships either vertically (`V`) or horizontally (`H`).
- On your turn, choose coordinates to strike the opponent's grid.
- `[X]` = Hit, `[W]` = Miss
- 16 turns max per player. Whoever sinks more units wins!

---

## ✅ Highlights

- Manual and random ship placement logic
- Turn counter and win detection logic
- Funny in-game references (“Stop singing soldier…” 😄)
- Save/Load allows pausing and resuming at any time
